Guide to Running Pose Estimation with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This guide will help you set up and run the pose estimation script using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The script captures real-time video from a webcam (or a video file) and detects human pose landmarks.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or later). You will also need the following libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)

MediaPipe (mediapipe)

Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Running the Script

Save the script as pose_estimation.py.

Run the script using the following command:

python pose_estimation.py

Alternative: Running with a Video File

If you want to process a video file instead of the webcam, replace the following line in the script:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

with:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path_to_video.mp4")

Replace "path_to_video.mp4" with the actual path to your video file.

How It Works

The script initializes the MediaPipe Pose model.

It captures frames from the webcam or video.

Each frame is processed to detect pose landmarks.

The detected landmarks are drawn on the image.

The output is displayed in real-time, showing both the raw pose keypoints and a connected skeleton.

Keyboard Controls

Press q to exit the program.

Troubleshooting

No video source detected? Ensure your webcam is connected or provide a valid video file path.

ModuleNotFoundError? Double-check that opencv-python and mediapipe are installed properly.

Slow performance? Try reducing the video resolution by modifying new_width and new_height in the script.

Next Steps

Extend the script to perform real-time analysis of human movements.

Use pose data for applications like fitness tracking, gaming, or gesture control.

Integrate the pose estimation with deep learning models for advanced motion analysis.

Happy coding!
